(CNN) â€” When it comes to novel coronavirus safety, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests facial hair be kept to a minimum so it fits within a facepiece respirator.
Side whiskers, soul patches, lampshades and handlebar mustaches are good to go, according to a CDC infographic. But styles like a stubble, beard, Dali and mutton chops, are not recommended because they are likely to interfere with a facepiece respirator.
Masks and respirators are being utilized around the world to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has reached more than 80,000 cases globally. A respirator covers at least the nose and mouth and protects against particles including infectious agents, the CDC said. However, the CDC does not recommend routine use outside of workplaces.
Facial hair poses a risk to the effectiveness of respirators because it may keep the exhalation valve from working properly if the two come into contact, the infographic said.
No matter the style choice, the hair should not cross the respirator sealing surface, the infographic said.
A goatee, horseshoe and villain mustache are okay, with caution, the infographic noted.
