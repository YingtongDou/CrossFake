Amazon Deliveries!!!!!!
I received an amazon delivery this morning. The driver was almost to his truck by the time I opened the door, bent to pick up the box, and said thank you. He turned and walked back toward the house. He said “Ma’am, these deliveries come from the distribution center. We’ve had positive testing for the virus. Leave the box out here in the sun for 6/8 hours, then open the box and take the item out of any packaging before you take it in the house. Leave the box and packaging outside. Then go wash your hands immediately.”
Wow. Good information but this is getting freaky!
