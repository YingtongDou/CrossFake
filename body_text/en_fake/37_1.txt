A new poll shows some Americans are no longer drinking Corona beer because of the coronavirus.
According to Cision PR Newswire, in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak across the world, the 5W Public Relations poll about Corona beer offers multiple opinions from consumers. It found that 38% of beer-drinking Americans have said they will no longer purchase Corona beer “under any circumstances.”
Among Corona beer drinkers, just 4% said they would stop drinking the beer because of the virus. However, they wouldn’t feel comfortable ordering a Corona beer from a public venue.
Another 16% of voters admitted they were confused about whether or not there was any relation between Corona beer and the coronavirus.

Following the release of the poll results, Ronn Torossian, Founder, and CEO of 5WPR released a statement about the beer brand.

“There is no question that Corona beer is suffering because of the coronavirus. Could one imagine walking into a bar and saying ‘Hey, can I have a Corona?’ or ‘Pass me A Corona.’ While the brand has claimed that consumers understand there’s no linkage between the virus and the beer company, this is a disaster for the Corona brand. After all, what brand wants to be linked to a virus which is killing people worldwide?”

The latest news follows the release of a new Corona beer ad. On Monday, Corona tweeted a short video featuring four new beer flavors.
“Introducing Corona Hard Seltzer. Four delicious flavors. One splashy entrance,” the tweet read.

Despite the poll results, Constellation Brands insists the coronavirus isn’t affecting their business because its customers “understand there is no link between the virus and our business.”
