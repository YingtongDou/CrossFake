If you were screaming “open Kentucky” last week..and now are griping about the fact that Kentucky is going to open, but you have to wear a mask....

I wear a mask in public, not for me, but for YOU. I want you to know that I am educated enough to know that, I am exposed to this virus daily therefore, I could be asymptomatic and still give you the virus. I don’t “live in fear” of the virus-- I just want to be a part of the solution, not the problem. I don’t feel the “government is controlling me”; I feel like I’m being a contributing adult to society and I want to teach my children the same. I want them to grow up as I did knowing that the world doesn’t revolve around me... that it’s not all about me and my personal comfort...that if we all could live with the consideration of others in mind, this whole world would be a much better place.

Wearing a mask doesn’t make me weak, scared, stupid or even “controlled”; it makes me considerate.
