Elisa Granato, the first volunteer who availed herself in Oxford for a jab in the first Europe human trial of a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus pandemic has died.
She died two days after the vaccine was administered, authorities have said and added that an investigation into the cause of the death has been initiated.
A statement by the researchers said Elisa had complications few hours after taking the vaccine and died while on admission.
Elisa Granato, who is a scientist, was one of the two who received the jab. Four other volunteer are said to be battling complications due to adverse reactions of the vaccine.
Officials say the four persons are being monitored against any adverse effects of the vaccine.
After taking her shot, Elisa Granato told the BBC: “I’m a scientist, so I wanted to try to support the scientific process wherever I can.”
Researchers who are awaiting for an autopsy to be conducted believe the Elisa had an underlying health condition which was not disclosed to health officials.
“The four in critical conditions will be fine and these are expected reactions from the vaccines, hence a trial.” the researchers revealed and added that these observations would help improve on the vaccine before it becomes available for use by the public.
