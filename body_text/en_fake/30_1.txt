After more than 30 years on the air, The Simpsons has created enough content to drive some fans to ask - do they have a crystal ball, or does satire simply come in waves as history tends to repeat itself?
Current events have led fans to highlight old Simpsons clips once again.
CORRECTION: In a previous version of this article, we highlighted how Simpsons fans had discovered a theory that the show had predicted Coronavirus and Tom Hank's diagnosis of Coronavirus over a decade ago. But we got the story wrong. The theory was actually a combination of a plotline from The Simpsons Movie (2007) where Tom Hanks goes into isolation during an environmental crisis, and an episode of the show in 1993, 'Marge in Chains' about a virus that spreads across Springfield, devastating humans. It turns out that the show did not, in fact, predict that Tom Hanks would get coronavirus or that he would go into self-isolation due to a global virus. We regret the error.
